## What is a Structure?
A structure is a user-defined data type that allows grouping of variables of different data types.

## Why Use Structures?
- To represent real-world entities
- To store related data together
- To make programs organized and readable

## Programs:
1. Basic structure example
2. Array of structures
3. Passing structure to function

## Concepts Covered:
- Structure declaration
- Structure variable
- Array of structures
- Structure as function argument

“Structures help manage complex data by combining different data types into a single logical unit.”
